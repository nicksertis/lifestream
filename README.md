# LifeStream
Feeds all notes, ideas, memories, events and information in your life into a single stream of consciousness

This project will initially seek to replicate the methodology of http://bulletjournal.com/ in digital format. The key component of the system will be a 'stream' that consists of endless lines of individual information. A line can be a to-do item, a calendar event, a meeting action-point or even the name of the song currently playing on Spotify. In the case of Bullet Journal: bullets such as tasks, events and notes.

What's great about LifeStream? It's simple to use, instantly searchable and will host an API to allow 3rd party developers access to your LifeStream.
